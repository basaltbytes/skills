# Public-Facing Copy

## Rule

Write public artifacts for the reader who encounters the project cold. Do not expose the private conversation, the agent's reasoning trail, discarded alternatives, emotional context, or implementation diary.

## Use For

- README and documentation edits
- PR titles and PR bodies
- changelogs and release notes
- package metadata and marketplace copy
- website or landing-page text
- issue summaries that external contributors may read

## Workflow

1. Identify the audience and artifact.
   - Public user: explain what they can do.
   - Maintainer: summarize the end state and operational impact.
   - Reviewer: state what changed and why it matters to review.

2. Translate private context into public value.
   - Private: "we discussed matching another project's installer UX."
   - Public: "Install globally with npm, then pin the project-local version."
   - Private: "we do not have every installer channel yet."
   - Public: omit it unless the user explicitly asks for an installation matrix.

3. Prefer affirmative, current-state wording.
   - Say what is supported, required, shipped, fixed, or changed.
   - Avoid cataloging what is absent, postponed, rejected, or considered.
   - Mention limitations only when they prevent a likely user mistake.

4. For PR bodies, summarize the final diff.
   - Do not include a chronological work log.
   - Do not mention back-and-forth, private rationale, failed attempts, or prompt history.
   - Include concise bullets for product/runtime impact and tests when useful.

5. Before finalizing, scan for leakage.
   - Remove phrases like "not yet", "we discussed", "we decided", "I changed", "I found", "currently not", "future", "roadmap", "fallback", "internal", "private", "thought process".
   - Keep compatibility notes concrete and user-facing, for example "Windows users should run inside WSL2."
   - If a negative statement remains, verify it protects the reader from a real mistake.

## Examples

Bad README copy:

```md
We considered several installer channels, but only the npm path is ready right now.
```

Better README copy:

```md
Install the CLI with npm:

npm install -g @basaltbytes/odoo-agentic-dev
```

Bad PR summary:

```md
After several attempts, I first wrote the docs one way, then corrected them after feedback.
```

Better PR summary:

```md
Adds a packed npm install smoke test and documents the npm-based install flow.
```

## Final Check

- The copy serves the external reader, not the private conversation.
- The text describes shipped behavior, not internal reasoning.
- Necessary limitations are phrased as practical guidance.
- PR summaries describe the final state of the branch against the target branch.
